# Agaricus-Bispours-mushroom--classification
  In this notebook, I will be dealing with the Mushroom Classification by using Random Forest Classifier, SVM, XGBooster Classifier. 
I will work on the EDA of this dataset by using Seaborn and Plotly libraries.

For the next step, I will deal with the missing data points -if they exist -, and then encode the dataset for the data pre-processing step.

Finally, I will train 3 different models which are Random Forest Classifier, SVM, and XGBoost Classifier.

About Dataset
-
Context
Although this dataset was originally contributed to the UCI Machine Learning repository nearly 30 years ago, mushroom hunting (otherwise known as "shrooming") is enjoying new peaks in popularity. Learn which features spell certain death and which are most palatable in this dataset of mushroom characteristics. And how certain can your model be?

Content
This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

Conclusions. 
-

-- For the next step, I trained 3 different machine learning models which are Random Forest Classifier, SVM, and finally, XGBClassifier.Due to the results of these machine learning models, I obtained %100 accuracy for each machine learning model. As far as I search about the Discussion Forum    of this dataset, it is pretty common for everyone. And as far as analyzed the errors of the models, every 3 models do not perform overfitting.
